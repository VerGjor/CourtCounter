<b> # Score Keeper App</b>

<h1>Udacity reqiurements:</h1>

<h2>Build Your Project</h2>

To complete this project, you will need to build a Score Keeper app. You can either start from scratch, or customize the Court Counter app you made as part of Practice set 2.

In either case, you will need to select a sport or game to track. Importantly, you'll need to select a sport with either multiple ways to score points or multiple metrics to track. If you have trouble choosing, here are some suggestions:

Baseball Scores App: Track both runs and outs
American Football Scores App: Add a button for each of the 4 amounts of points a team can score in american football.
Football Scores app: Track both points and fouls
Your project will be evaluated using the Score Keeper project rubric.

<h1>Information</h1>

The modifications I made to the CourtCounter is that I turned the app from a team sport(I'm guessing it was about football or something) to an app for keeping the score of a tennis match. It has information for when it is deuce and we can revert to 40:40 if the player that has advantage looses his chance to win the game. When one of the player wins 6 points, the buttons for adding points is disabled, and there is a new TextView that comes into the screen and it congratulates the winner.
